# Simulating wildfires with Cellular automata
We simulate wildfires with cellular automata with C/C++. We include and OpenMP and a CUDA implementation.

## Usage

## Content

### WithGUI

Implementations with graphical visualisation of the evolution of the wildfire. 

+ 'forest_serial.cpp': Serial implementation of the basic model.

+ 'forest_serial_wind.cpp': Serial implementation of the model incorporating wind.

+ 'forest_omp.cpp': Parallel implementation of the model using OpenMP.
